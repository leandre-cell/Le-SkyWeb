<h6><b><i><p> All information on the Deadly pandemic of corona virus or COVID 19 that is affecting the whole world is here.</p></i></b></h6>
<h2><p><b><u>The Origin of corona virus</u></b></p></h2>
<h4>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the new coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China, a pandemic.
<p>As of April 20, the global death toll surpassed 168,500 amid more than 2.4 million cases. More than 643,000 people have recovered from the disease worldwide, according to the data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in the United States, and from other websites and sources, also with the collaboration of us, "LE SKYWEB".</p>

<h3><b><u>What is a coronavirus?</u></b></h3>
<p>The coronavirus family causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), according to the WHO.
<hr>
<b><h3><u><i>Corona virus or COVID 19</i></u></h3></b>
<p><i><h5>This article is about the group of viruses. For the disease involved in the 2019 to 2020 coronavirus pandemic, see Coronavirus disease 2019. For the virus that causes this disease, see Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.</h5></i>
<p>Coronaviruses are a group of <i>related viruses </i>that cause diseases in <i>mammals and birds</i>. 
<br>In humans, coronaviruses cause <i> respiratory tract infections</i> that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
<p> Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. 
<p>There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
<p>The coronavirus spike protein is a <i>multifunctional molecular machine</i> that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. It first binds to a <i>receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit.</i> Two domains in S1 from different coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, leading to viral attachment.
<p> The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, <i>prefusion and postfusion.</i> 
<p>The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions.
<p> I further discuss the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion, in the context of the corresponding functions from other viruses and host cells.
<p>They circulate in animals and some can be transmitted between animals and humans. Several coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.
<p>The new coronavirus, the seventh known to affect humans, has been named COVID-19.

<TD> Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that have a halo, or crown-like (corona) appearance when viewed under an electron microscope.
<p>
The coronavirus is now recognized as the etiologic agent of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Additional specimens are being tested to learn more about this coronavirus, and its etiologic link with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
<p>It is stated on the CDC website for a coloured version of the image that this depicts the (Avian) Infectious bronchitis virus.

<h3><b><u>What are the symptoms?</u></b></h3>
<p>Common signs of infection include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
<p>The incubation period of COVID-19 is thought to be between one and 14 days. It is contagious before symptoms appear, which is why so many people get infected.
<p>Infected patients can be also <i>asymptomatic</i>, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.
<p>Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may appear two to 14 days after exposure and can include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fever</b></li>
<li><b>Cough</b></li>
<li><b>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</b></li>
    <u><p>Other symptoms can include:</p></u>
<li><b>Tiredness</b></li>
<li><b>Aches</b></li>
<li><b>Runny nose</b></li>
<li><b>Sore throat</b></li>
<li><b>Headache</b></li>
<li><b>Diarrhea</b></li>
<li><b>Vomiting</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have experienced the <b>loss of smell or taste.</b>
<p>The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have no symptoms at all. 
<p>People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness. 
<p>This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as <i>influenza.</i>
<p>According to the WHO, more signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.
<p>In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and thus Death.
<p>Current estimates of the incubation period - the time between infection and the onset of symptoms - range from one to 14 days. Most infected people show symptoms within five to six days.
<p>However, infected patients can also be asymptomatic, meaning they do not display any symptoms despite having the virus in their systems.

<h3><u><b>Where did it come from?</b></u></h3>
<p>It all started in China in the ending of the year 2019 and entered the year 2020.<p>
China alerted the WHO to cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan on December 31.<p>
COVID-19 is thought to have originated in a seafood market where wildlife was sold illegally.
On February 7, Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from an infected animal to humans through illegally trafficked pangolins, prized in Asia for food and medicine.
Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as possible sources.</p>
